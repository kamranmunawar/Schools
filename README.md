## PROJECT:
School information on the map

## NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF PROJECT
In this project, I gather school rating data from Ofsted and postcode information from the Office for National Statistics. The objective is to merge these datasets and visualize the school information on a map using the plotly.graph_objects library. By combining the school ratings with geographical data, I can create an interactive map that provides valuable insights into the distribution and quality of schools across the desired area
